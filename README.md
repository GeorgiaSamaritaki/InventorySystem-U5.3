# InventorySystem 

I designed a modular inventory system as an Actor Component that can be attached to characters. The design draws inspiration from *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*'s menu system, while maintaining simplicity to meet project requirements. The implementation primarily uses Blueprints for logic and widget communication, while the core inventory database functionality is handled in C++ for cleaner data management and improved readability.

The system features comprehensive functionality including item pickup, stacking, drag-and-drop mechanics with stack merging, item usage, and sorting capabilities. The inventory data is stored in a database that dynamically updates both world items and inventory views. The system is designed with future expandability in mind, including support for additional inventory tabs.
